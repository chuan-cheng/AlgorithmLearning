Russian Peasant Algorithm

Introduction
An multiplying two numbers by doubling the first number and halving the second number repeatedly till the second number becomes 0.
In the process whenever the second number become odd, we add the first number to result(result is initialized as 0).

Explanation
axb = (ax2)x(b/2)
for even values of b: axb = (ax2)x(b/2)
for odd values of b: axb = (ax2)x (b-1)/2 + a


Pesudocode
1)Initialize result 'res' as 0
2)Do the following while 'b' is greater than 0
  a)If 'b' is odd, add 'a' to 'res'
  b)Double 'a' and halve 'b'
3)Return 'res'

Complexity
Worst case time complexity: Θ(logn)
Space complexity: Θ(1)
